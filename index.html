    <div class="description">
      <p>This club started with a small group of UT students drinking tea in their balcony. Wanting to bring new ideas and hoping to broaden discussions, the idea of inviting the student body to participate in casual philosophical conversations about anything was materialized.</p>
      <p >The Tea Club provides a large variety of tea for you to drink - hot water and cup included. Just bring your favorite topic of discussion, and a friend.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, The Tea Club is no longer active.</p>
